Overview
The Phonebook application is a simple command-line program that allows users to manage contacts. Users can insert, search, display, delete, and update contacts, as well as analyze the efficiency of the search algorithm. The application uses a singly linked list to store contact information.

Features
Insert Contact: Add a new contact with a name and phone number.
Search Contact: Search for a contact by name (case-insensitive).
Display All Contacts: Display all contacts in the phonebook.
Delete Contact: Remove a contact by name.
Update Contact: Change the phone number of an existing contact.
Analyze Search Efficiency: Display the time complexity of the search algorithm.
Structure
The application consists of two main classes:

Contact: Represents an individual contact with attributes for name, phone number, and a reference to the next contact in the list.
Phonebook: Manages the list of contacts and provides methods for manipulating the contact list.
